            Hello! My name is Rahul and I enjoy creating things that live on the
            internet. My interest in web development started back in 2016 when I
            decided to clone Tinder as my learning project â€” turns out hacking
            together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about PHP, HTML
            &amp; CSS!

            {skills.map((skill) => (
              <p>
                <FaTerminal /> {(" ", skill)}
              </p>
            ))}
            ;

          <br />

        <div className="rr_about-image">

      </div>
    </div>
  );
